            Startline provides multiple plans to suit you and your business’s need. All plans are charged monthly with no contracts, no
            setup fees, and no hidden gimmicks.

            You are free to upgrade or downgrade to any plan anytime. Plan changes will be made effective after the next billing date<br /><br />We
            offer a monthly subscription service with no long-term contracts. <br />Users are billed monthly for the upcoming month's
            service. The subscription can be terminated at any time before the next billing date without any penalties or refunds.
            <br /><br /><b>Here's how our termination policy works:</b><br /><br />
            <ol>
              <li>
                <b>Payment Cycle:</b> When a user signs up for our service, they are billed for the upcoming month. The subscription plan
                runs from the day of payment until the day before the next payment date.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <b>Refunds:</b> Once a payment date has passed, refunds are not provided for that billing cycle. Users are responsible for
                the full monthly fee if they cancel after the payment date has passed.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <b>Termination:</b> Upon cancellation, the subscription will remain active until the end of the current billing cycle and
                automatic renewal will stop. Users will not be billed for the subsequent month.
